# printf
This is a collaborative project between Ivy Chelsea and Dennis Njoroge, students at Alx under the Software
Engineering programme, where a function named "_printf" imitates actual "printf" command located in the
stndard library. It contains some of the basic features and functions found in the manual 3 of "printf".
